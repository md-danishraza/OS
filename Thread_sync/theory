Thread synchronization is a mechanism that ensures that two or more concurrent threads do not simultaneously execute the same program segment called critical section.

thread sync techniques

1. Locks
2. Rlocks
3. Semaphores

<!-- Locks -->

lock has two states
Locked :- lock has been acquired by one thread and so other threads cannot acquire it until the lock is released
Unlocked :- lock has not been acquired by any thread and so other threads can make an attempt to acquire it.

steps
create a lock object of lock class from thread
acquire(blocking = True, timeout = -1) to acquire the lock
release() to release the lock
