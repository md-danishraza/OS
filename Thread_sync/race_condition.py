'''
A race condition in an operating system happens when the behavior of software depends on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events like threads or processes executing. When multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization, the final outcome can vary, leading to unpredictable bugs. Picture two chefs trying to use the same kitchen without coordinatingâ€”might get some weird dishes! Got any more OS-related wonders on your mind?
